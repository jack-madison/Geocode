# Geocode

This reposity contains the code to retrieve the latitude and longitude for a dataset of addresses. The python code utilizes the google maps geocode api in order to find the latitude and longitude of each of the addresses listed in the Excel workbooks "local_associations.xlsx" and "health_care_center.xlsx". The API key used has been included in a separate python file and added to .gitignore for privacy reasons. Instructions for how to obtain an API key can be found here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
